##Demonstration:
In this simple sample I just try to use most up to dated technologies, third parties and libraries in android development,
As as Android developer you always must be aware of what's going on, some momentary solutions
cause some big issues in the future.
* I'm so sorry, but I really want to make Test Modules with Robotium or Essperso but I didn't have sufficient time. :"(

It's my pleasure to do this for You!
